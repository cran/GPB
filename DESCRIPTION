Description: Functions that compute the distribution functions for the Generalized Poisson Binomial distribution as described in Zhang et al. (2018)<doi: 10.1080/00949655.2018.1440294>, which provides the cdf, pmf, quantile function, and random number generation for the distribution. The C code for fast Fourier transformation (FFT) is written by R Core Team (2019)<https://www.R-project.org/>, which implements the FFT algorithm in Singleton (1969) <doi: 10.1109/TAU.1969.1162042>.
